## A holistic approach to internal pain points

{{< lead >}}
Build processes that are system dependent -- not people dependent {{< /lead >}}

## Build systems that scale
- HSH is a growing mid-sized local company hitting the ceiling in MA and needs to streamline processes on top of it's solid foundation in order to continue to grow
- Solidify best practices, reduce error prone excel and word workflows, less time spent locating things, asking questions that have already been answered. 
- Software processes are data drive and can provide knowledge capture from employees that can benefit the company even after they part ways
- If a business is setup with simple and well oiled processes, you should be able to get a person with the bare minimum qualifications to output good work. 
	- If you're dependent on good people to output good work then you will hit a bottleneck eventually 

## Employee Retention, Attraction, & Utilization 
- Less busy work and helpful tools that make days easier than at other companies
- Good tooling minimizes the gap between top performers and low performers 
- Stop competing for, highly trained - top talent, and build systems that enable highly effective entry level people and scales with them
- Younger people want to see the company is keeping up with new tech and taking an exciting approach to problems, especially in a largely archaic industry 
- More resilience in difficult hiring times
