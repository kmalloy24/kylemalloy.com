When I'm not doing freelance work, I'm working on practical training courses and developing software for civil engineers as well as writing about the intersections between civil engineering and programming. 

#### CivSoft

In 2023 I founded [CivSoft](civsoft.app) with my wife, Chandler. 

We are currently working on QuicCalc & QuicSpecs. 

Web apps to help streamline workflows and document management for preparing engineer estimates and writing special provisions. 

#### Training
- Setup a site plan with files from subcontractors
- build 3d models in beyondcad
- prepare engineer estimates
- model a complex intersection as a Corridor in Civil 3D

About a year ago, I quit my 9-5 as a civil engineer in Boston. My wife and I decided it was time for a hard reset, and took off in a converted church van to travel the US, hiking as much as possible along the way. Our travels landed us in far west Texas where we now live off-grid with our dog Bernie, who we picked up along the way. 

#### Writing
- blog
- newsletter 



my favorite colors in CAD are {{< icon "150" >}} (150) {{< icon "72" >}} (72)

i cofounded [civsoft](https://civsoft.app/) with my wife. while im staring at CAD, she is coding 

We are currently expanding our programming skills in order to build web apps that will help civil engineers simplify work flows and get more time back in their days.
