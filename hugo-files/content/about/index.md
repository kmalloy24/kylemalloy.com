A year ago I left my 9-5 as a civil engineer in Boston. My wife and I decided it was time for a hard reset. So we took off in a converted church van to travel the US. 

We spent everyday hiking and seeing new places -- it was the best year of my life. 

Our travels landed us in Far West Texas, where we now live off-grid with our dog Bernie. 

My favorite colors for new layers in CAD are {{< icon "140" >}} 140 & {{< icon "101" >}} 101.
