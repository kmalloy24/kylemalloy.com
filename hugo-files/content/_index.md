Hi 👋🏼 my name is Kyle 👷🏼‍♂️

I have extensive experience as a civil engineer using AutoCAD Civil 3D for design in both land development and roadway projects. I've been through each stage of the project lifecycle many times over, and pair my technical skills with excellent organizational and communication skills.

I'm currently working on building software for civil engineers at {{< icon "civsoft" >}}[CivSoft](civsoft.app) -- which I co-founded with my wife, Chandler.

If you are interested in working together please schedule a time to meet here 👇🏼
