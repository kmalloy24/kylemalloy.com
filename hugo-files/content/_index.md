Hi my name is Kyle 👋🏼

I have 8+ years of experience as a civil engineer using AutoCAD Civil 3D for design in both land development and roadway projects.

I have 1+ years of self-taught software development experience building high performance apps for the web.

<!-- My adjacent interests are inclusive transportation, sustainable development, and web accessibility.  -->

When I'm not working I like to read, cook, and go for hikes with my wife, Chandler, and our dog Bernie. My favorite colors in CAD are {{< icon "140" >}} 140 & {{< icon "101" >}} 101.
